All 4 kicked me off their VPS for using to much. Rouster hosting has some top notch hardware capable of outperforming all other providers i have tired. Their 4Gb/2 Core/80gb in Montreal at under 10$ outperformed turkey‚Äôs 12 core vps that i think was 35-40$. Turkey kicked me off within 12 hours and told me i had to upgrade to their dedicated systems. I am now on a 4 Core/ 8GB also in montreal just hours away from where I live. Plus is meant for high resource use and honestly the thing is a tank. Its so fast that i feel like i‚Äôm using a fully dedicated workstation. Additionally customer service is great. They were out of stock and brought more online because i needed. Plus when there was (the only) tech issue i ever had with them they fixed all up and didn‚Äôt try to make me pay for down time. I can only speak for their windows vps but one of reasons they are impossible to beat on cost is they offer VDS. Not just a plain VPS so resources are actually dedicated to the VS instead of oversold or shared. Plus they offer windows OS without doubling or tripling your rental cost which is a rare exception among providers."
